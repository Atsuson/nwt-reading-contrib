Feel free to contribute.


### Translation

If you want to make the NWT Reading app available in another language, this is a fairly easy task:

1. Download the english template ([template.js](https://github.com/wfleischer/nwt-reading-contrib/blob/master/languages/template.mjs)) from the repository and start translation right within the file.
1. Then either create an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/wfleischer/nwt-reading-contrib/issues) and attach the translation or send it as email to support@searchwork.org.


### App Development

If you are familiar with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and are interested in contributing to the app development, please send a note to support@searchwork.org.


## Frequently Asked Questions ##
### Does the NWT Reading app meet the [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/en/terms-of-use/) of the [jw.org](https://jw.org) site? ###

It does, as the following paragraphs of the [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/en/terms-of-use/) show:
> What constitutes proper use? Subject to the restrictions set out below, you may:
> 
> ...
>
> Share links to or electronic copies of downloadable publications, videos, or audio programs on this site.

Besides its main purpose of keeping track of the personal Bible reading program, the NWT Reading app does exactly what is described above: it shares links to the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures as a convenience for the user. The corresponding jw.org web page with the Bible text is opened in a browser widget.

> You may not:
> 
> ...
> 
> Distribute artwork, electronic publications, trademarks, music, photos, text, or videos from this website with or as part of any software application (including uploading such materials to a server for use by a software application).

The NWT Reading app does not contain copyrighted material. It only links to the jw.org web site.

The other paragraphs in the Terms of Use do obviously not apply to this app.
